# Animeto

An anime search engine that helps users determine the next anime they should watch! Made possible using [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/) API.

## Key Features

The user will be able to

- Explicitly search for an anime to watch
- Use a filter to have results pop up related to what they chose (only show anime in X genre)
- Look at information relating to the anime such as (but not limited to)
  - Rating
  - Synopsis
  - Number of episodes

## Stretch Goals

The user will eventually be able to

- Add anime they want to watch to a list
- Remove anime from their watch list once they have finished it
- Create a list of anime they have already seen, preventing it from showing up when searching for a new anime to watch

## Super Stretch Goals

The user will hopefully one day be able to

- Create their own profile so that they can save their lists and refer back to them later/continue to add on to it
- Rearrange their watch list in order of importance to them
- Have all of these same functionalities for finding new manga to read
